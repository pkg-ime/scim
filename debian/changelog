scim (1.4.7-1) unstable; urgency=low

  The "keeping up with upstream" release.

  * New upstream release.
    - Include missing header, this time <cstring>, for a few files, to make
      scim buildable with (the constantly evolving) GCC 4.3.
      (Closes: #417686, again)
    - Remove an infinite loop with 0.1 second timeout in the X11 frontend to
      avoid waking up CPU constantly, therefore preserve power consumption and
      extend laptop battery life.  (Fixes LP: #122445)
    - Change 10_gtk-immodule-install-dir dpatch to patch configure.ac instead
      of extras/gtk2_immodule/Makefile.am, to adapt to the upstream change.
    - Regenerate 90_relibtoolize dpatch.  Also adjust the timestamp touching
      in debian/rules accordingly.
  * Clarify build dependency.
    - Remove intltool as upstream tarball ships its own 0.33 version.
    - Add libpango1.0-dev, libglib2.0-dev, and pkg-config explicitly (used to
      be pulled in by libgtk2.0-dev).
  * Add libx11-dev as a dependency of libscim-dev explicitly, it used to be
    pulled in by libgtk2.0-dev.
  * Add scim-thai to scim's "Suggests:" list.
  * Add "-W -g" compiler flags back.  The warnings are somehow useful when
    reading the build logs, and the debug information will be useful for
    manually built packages with DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS=nostrip.
  * Change maintainer's email address.

scim (1.4.6-1) unstable; urgency=low

  The "Oh, shiny!" release.

  * New upstream release.  (Closes: #399736)
    - Include <climits> header in src/scim_iconv.cpp, fixing FTBFS with GCC
      4.3.  Thanks to Martin Michlmayr for testing and the patch.
      (Closes: #417686)
    - The "Exit" item in the menu of notification area icon is built by
      default now, so that users can quit scim from the graphical interface.
      (Closes: #417950)
    - ABI changed, bump shlibs version to libscim8c2a (>= 1.4.6).
    - Add debian/libscim-dev.NEWS file to alert the changes of module
      installation path (will be installed as the NEWS.Debian file for
      libscim-dev package).  Also rename debian/NEWS file to debian/scim.NEWS.
  * For the install directory of GTK IM module, use GTK binary version from
    pkg-config results instead of hardcoded value.  Thanks to Loïc Minier for
    the patch.  (Closes: #420497)
  * Rename 11_relibtoolize.dpatch to 90_relibtoolize.dpatch and regenerate it.
  * Correct a typo in the package description of scim.
  * Add XS-Vcs-Svn and XS-Vcs-Browser fields.
  * Use ${source:Version} and ${binary:Version} for versioned dependencies
    instead of deprecated ${Source-Version}.  Add dpkg-dev (>= 1.13.19) to
    Build-Depends to support this format.
  * Add "Enhances: scim" relationship for scim-gtk2-immodules and
    scim-modules-socket.

scim (1.4.4-8) unstable; urgency=low

  The "etch is released, welcome lenny" release.

  * Rewrite debian/rules.
    - Use the platform detection code recommended by autotools-dev.
    - Drop unused "-W -g" compiler flags.
    - Do not use binary-common target anymore and separate binary-arch and
      binary-indep target completely.
    - Add more safeguarding code to detect building errors.
    - Finally remove all the cruft introduced by dh_make.
  * Adapt to GTK+ 2.10 ABI change.  (Closes: 419314)
    - Install GTK IM module into /usr/lib/gtk-2.0/2.10.0/immodules.
    - Bump libgtk2.0-dev build dependency to >= 2.10.1-1.
    - Use dh_gtkmodules in debian/rules instead of calling
      update-gtk-immodules in maintainer scripts.  The postinst and postrm
      scripts for scim-gtk2-immodule are empty now and therefore removed.
    - Add ${misc:Depends} to scim-gtk2-immodule's dependency list, and remove
      libgtk2.0-bin.
  * Update debian/watch file to format version 3 and use qa.debian.org
    redirector for sourceforge.net.
  * Drop libxt-dev in build dependency as it's not necessary anymore after
    relibtoolization.

  * Relibtoolize.  Add one big patch 11_relibtoolize.dpatch for all the
    autotools generated files.
  * Make scim-gtk2-immodule depend on libgtk2.0-bin explicitly as it uses
    /usr/sbin/update-gtk-immodules in the maintainer scripts.  Thanks to caleb
    on OFTC.
  * Fix the postrm script of scim-gtk2-immodule so that it can be removed
    cleanly when libgtk2.0-bin is already removed (This is Ubuntu bug #52087).
